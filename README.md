# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm

I practice the implementation of data structures and algorithms in C and Java for course assignments.

The .cpp files can be compiled in Visual Studio, Windows 10 system.

compiler of C projects: gcc
operating system: Linux (ubuntu)
command for compiling: make clean; make
command for running: ./main arguments

The JAVA files were compiled and run in Eclipse (Windows 10).
