The compiler I used is embedded in Visual Studio 2019; operation system is Window10.

There are two source files for my submission of HW3, one is "Kmeans.cpp" for original data, 
another is "Kmeans_norm" for normalized data.

When passing arguments, click "Tools --> Command Line --> Developer Command Prompt",
enter commands(for example):
$cl Kmeans.cpp
$Kmeans ../WineData_2col 3
