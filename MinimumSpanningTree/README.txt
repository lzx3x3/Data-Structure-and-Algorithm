My codes were compiled and run in Eclipse (Windows 10).

I created 3 JAVA files and put them in the same src folder:
RunExperiments.JAVA includes 'computeMST', 'recomputeMST' and 'parseEdges' functions;
2 classes were built in Graph.JAVA and Node.JAVA, separately; class 'Grach' and class 'Node' were both used in RunExperiments.JAVA

When parsing arguments, I edit 'Run configurations' in Eclipse, click 'Arguments', enter 
'./rmat0406.gr ./rmat0406.extra ./0406_output.txt' for example, apply it and run.
